# Environment Setup

This session requires a text editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) tools for interfacing with [GitHub](https://github.com/), and finally [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to host the application.

## Install a Text editor

Begin by installing a text editor.  Any editor will work, however [Atom](https://atom.io) will be used for the live session.  Navigate to the URL above and follow the prompts to download the Atom installer, then run it and follow the prompts to install it.

## Install Git tools

Next, we need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) so that we can work with repositories and push our changes to GitHub.  Navigate to the URL above, then download and install Git.  Accept all of the default options when prompted.

## Install Node.js

Finally, we need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run our application.  Doing so will also install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), a package manager which we will use to simplify installation of code packages as we build our application.
