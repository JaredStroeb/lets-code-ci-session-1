# Environment Setup

This session requires a text editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) tools for interfacing with [GitHub](https://github.com/), and finally [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to host the application.

## Install a Text editor

Begin by installing a text editor.  Any editor will work, however [Atom](https://atom.io) will be used for the live session.  Navigate to the URL above and follow the prompts to download the Atom installer, then run it and follow the prompts to install it.

## Install Git tools

Next, we need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) so that we can work with repositories and push our changes to GitHub.  Navigate to the URL above, then download and install Git.  Accept all of the default options when prompted.

## Install Node.js

Finally, we need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run our application.  Doing so will also install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), a package manager which we will use to simplify installation of code packages as we build our application.  Again, take all default options when prompted by the installer.

# Account Setup

Now that our environment is set up, we need to create accounts with the websites which will provide hosting for our repository, as well as the integrations we'll use.  

## Create a GitHub.com Account

Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create an account, if you don't already have one.  There's nothing tricky about signing up, however you will need to verify your email address before we can link to other services.

## Link Your GitHub Account to Travis CI

Navigate to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and click the top right button labeled "Sign in with GitHub" to link your GitHub account.  Accept the default permissions when prompted.  Once signed in move on to the next step.

## Link Your GitHub Account to Code Climate

Navigate to [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) and click the center button labeled "Get Started Free with GitHub".  Accept the default permissions and move on to the next step.

## Link Your GitHub Account to Codecov

Navigate to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) and click the left, black button labeled "Sign up with GitHub".  Accept the default permissions.
